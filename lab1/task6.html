    <p id="p1">How do you create a restaurant empire and become an overnight success 
        at the age of 52? As Ray Kroc said, “I was an overnight success all right, 
        but 30 years is a long, long night.”</p>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(50, 177, 88);">Origins</h1>
    <p class="p2">In 1917, 15-year-old Ray Kroc lied about his age to join the 
        Red Cross as an ambulance driver, but the war ended before his training 
        finished. He then worked as a piano player, a paper cup salesman and 
        a multi-mixer salesman. In 1954 he was surprised by a huge order for 
        8 multi-mixers from a restaurant in San Bernardino, California. 
        There he found a small but successful restaurant run by brothers Dick 
        and Mac McDonald, and was stunned by the effectiveness of their operation. 
        They produced a limited menu, concentrating on just a few items - burgers, 
        fries and beverages - which allowed them to focus on quality at every step.</p>
    <p style="color: red;">Kroc pitched his vision of creating McDonald's restaurants all over 
        the U.S. to the brothers. In 1955 he founded the McDonald's Corporation, and 
        5 years later bought the exclusive rights to the McDonald's name. By 1958, 
        McDonald's had sold its 100 millionth hamburger.</p>
